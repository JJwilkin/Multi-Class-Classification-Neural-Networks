# Multi-Class-Classification-Neural-Networks
## Hand-Written Digit recognition
implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits from 0-9

Used coursera data set of 5000 handwritten numbers with each number represented as a 20x20 matrix of grey scale pixel light intensity. using one-vs-all classification

implemented using octave
