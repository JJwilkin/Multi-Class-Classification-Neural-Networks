# Multi-Class-Classification-Neural-Networks
## Hand-Written Digit recognition
implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits from 0-9

Used coursera data set of 5000 handwritten numbers with each number represented as a 20x20 matrix of grey scale pixel light intensity. This in conjuction with the 5000 samples generated a 5000 x 400 matrix which was use to train a one-vs-all classification and predict using a 3 layer neural network.

implemented using octave
